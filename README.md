Scenario You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Characters and teams Cyclistic - A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

# Ask
In this step, I asked myself questions such as ‘How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?’ to guide my analysis. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing believes annual Members are much more profitable than Casual riders. As a junior data analyst working at Cyclistic, my task is to help the marketing team analyze the differences between Casual riders and Members with the goal of providing recommendations that will help convert Casual riders into annual Members to maximize profit.

# Prepare
I downloaded the dataset that is used for this case study and stored it. I was required to download data for the last 12 months. I downloaded trip data between June 2021-June 2022. You can access the datasets here. It is a public dataset provided by Motivate International Inc. (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

# Process
12 months of data was downloaded and stitched together using SQL (BigQuery). SQL was used to drop some unnecessary columns. The data was then cleaned, Wrangling and visualized in R. Tableau was used next to create a dashboard. 


# Analyze
I created the ride_length column to calculate the trip duration, Day_of_week to populate what day of the week the ride was taken in Excel. Pivot tables were used to help me summarize data. I then moved to RStudio to create data frames and visualize data with ggplot2. I calculated and summarized the data using functions such as mean, median, max, and min in R
